This holds the R code needed to do a replication of Ghitza and Gelman's 2013 paper using Stan.

The code is divided at two levels. First, the code is split into folders based on the code's purpose. Then, within each folder, there are R scripts (the R file(s) with "script" in its name) and R helper function files. So, the code that should be run within each file is the R script file.
